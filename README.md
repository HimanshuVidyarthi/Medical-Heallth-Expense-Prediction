# Medical Health Expense Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the future medical expenses of patients based on various factors. The goal is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate medical expenses based on features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), region, and smoking behavior.

## Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to **predict medical expenses** for individuals using a dataset with features like:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Region**
- **Smoking Behavior**

These factors are critical in determining an individual’s medical expenses and understanding these relationships can help in better decision-making for healthcare providers and insurance companies.

## Business Implications

Healthcare is at the core of everyone’s well-being, and maintaining good health is crucial for an individual’s physical, emotional, mental, and social abilities. This project serves as a step toward predicting and controlling healthcare expenses, benefiting both individuals and organizations involved in healthcare management.

## Data Analysis Techniques Used

### Univariate Analysis

- Analyzing individual features to understand their distribution.
- Deriving meaningful insights from both numerical and categorical variables.

### Bivariate Analysis

- Exploring the relationship between two variables.
- Understanding how one variable affects another in the dataset.

### Feature Scaling

- Normalizing the range of independent variables to improve the performance of machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Models Used

### Linear Regression

- A linear approach to model the relationship between independent and dependent variables.

**Assumptions of Linear Regression**:
- **Linearity**: The relationship between variables is linear.
- **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of errors remains constant.
- **Independence**: Observations are independent.
- **Normality**: All variables should follow a normal distribution.

### Random Forest

- An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and averages their outputs for regression tasks.

### Gradient Boosting Model

- A sequential learning model where each predictor builds on the previous one to optimize the model performance.

## Model Evaluation

- **R² Score**: Measures the strength of correlation between independent features and the target variable.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the differences between actual and predicted values.

## Cross Validation

- Used to evaluate the performance of models by splitting the data into different subsets to ensure that the model generalizes well on unseen data.

## Future Improvements

- Try different labels for regions to see if it improves model performance.
- Test with different approaches for handling outliers (e.g., including more children data).
- Apply additional transformation techniques like log or square root to normalize the expense column.

## Major Takeaways

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Helped uncover associations between features and medical expenses.
- **Handling Categorical Variables**: Methods to deal with such variables effectively.
- **Linear Regression Assumptions**: Learned the importance of validating assumptions before applying a model.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Gained experience with various models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Comparison**: Understood the significance of comparing multiple models to choose the best one for predictions.
